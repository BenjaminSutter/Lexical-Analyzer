# Lexical-Analyzer
Class project for Compiler Theory and Design
<br><br>
Used Skeleton code and Linux assets (g++, make, flex, and bison) to create and expand tokens/lexemes of a language to be scanned and read by a lexer. The project is part of a class in Compiler Theory and Design and is ongoing so ability to parse tokens will come in future projects.
