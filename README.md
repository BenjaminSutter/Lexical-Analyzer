# Lexical-Analyzer
Class project for Compiler Theory and Design
<br><br>
Used Skeleton code and Linux assets (g++, make, flex, and bison) to create and expand tokens/lexemes of a language to be scanned and read by a lexer. Files written in the given language would be read, parsed, and make note of any errors encountered during compile.
